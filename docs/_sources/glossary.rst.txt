   PLACE
     Python Laboratory Automation, Control, and Experimentation.

   experiment
     Within the PLACE context, an *experiment* refers to any execution of the
     PLACE software. In older versions of PLACE, this may also be referred to
     as a *scan*.

   module
     Refers to an independent group of files which instruct PLACE how to
     interact with specific hardware. Typically, this refers to both a Python
     backend interface with PLACE and a JavaScript frontend interface with the
     user. PLACE supports dynamic interaction with properly written modules.
