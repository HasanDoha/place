PyPAL  
=====

PyPAL is an open-source Python package for laboratory automation and waveform analysis.  

It provides driver modules for automating laboratory instruments, example implementation scripts, and modules for visualizing and processing waveform data.

A goal of PyPAL is to develop a repository of instrument drivers for laboratory automation.  In addition, rapid development of compatible processing software will streamline laboratory activity from acquisition through data analysis.
