PLACE is an open-source Python package for laboratory automation, control, and experimentation.  

It provides driver modules for automating laboratory instruments, example implementation scripts, and modules for visualizing and processing waveform data.

A goal of PLACE is to develop a repository of instrument drivers for laboratory automation.  In addition, rapid development of compatible processing software will streamline laboratory activity from acquisition through data analysis.

To install PLACE from the source:
Download the source code and unzip `PLACE-master.zip`.  From the `PLACE-master` folder, run the following from the command line to install:

python setup.py install
